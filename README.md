# The-Gaming-Room 
  The gaming room client was a client looking for us to help design their game and which platform would be best to host it. They were wanting to host their game on multiple different platforms whether it be windows mac etc. In this documentation I feel like I did well in giving them the advantages and disadvantage when it came to each platform available on hosting the game. Having a design document gives you a base to work off of when it comes to coding instead of just winging it. This can help stay organizing and make sure you achieve all goals required by the client. Interpreting the user needs is very important because they are the ones that will make the software a success or a failure, so making sure user needs are met is one of the most important goals. A technique I would use in the future when it comes to analyzing or designing a similar software would be taking all requirements into consideration whether it be user needs, client needs, which platform will I use, and what will make this successful I enjoyed this project for those reasons.
